                        A picture or reflection means different things to different 
                        people. A mirror evokes strong feelings and can be a glance 
                        into the future or the past to find the person you once were 
                        or wish to become. This is a 3D installation expressing my 
                        synesthetic feelings when I look at myself in the mirror.

                            The roof of the installation depicts the constant, 
                            loud thoughts which hit me and make me weaker. The 
                            texture created on the inner side of the roof is 
                            disturbing, craggy, and rocky and the color depicts 
                            the flesh and blood of the brain and also symbolizes 
                            its tenderness.

                            The basic idea behind the installation was that,
                            when I look at myself in the mirror, I feel that 
                            everything in the mirror is perfect, calm, and 
                            soothing and there is a sense of zeal to reach 
                            that place. But at the same time, I am stuck at 
                            the place where I am standing, in a mess of emotions,
                            thoughts, and work; and it is difficult or impossible 
                            to reach the other side. 
                            Even if we are on the colorful and glittery or the 
                            gloomy and dark side, we are still going to face 
                            societal opinions, expectations which will somehow 
                            influence us.

                    <div class="col-1-of-2">
                        <p class="para-judge">
                            The other side of the mirror depicts the utopian side 
                            which has different colors blended on the background. 
                            The use of fabric depicts the way I visualize calmness 
                            as a slow breeze brushing my skin. The colors yellow, 
                            pink, blue symbolizes warmth, optimism, calmness, peace, 
                            balance, and growth. 
                            The idea behind gold irregular lines on the 3D forms is 
                            inspired by the Japanese art form "Kintsugi"("Golden Joinery"). 
                            This symbolizes the philosophy of embracing imperfection, 
                            highlighting the cracks and repairs as simply an event in 
                            the life of the observer, rather than something to breakdown 
                            over.
