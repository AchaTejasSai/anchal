                            The font I have chosen is Algerian. The font is stable, 
                            sturdy, and yet it is flexible shown by the horizontal 
                            curve in the “A”. The font in itself is a very unique way
                            of representing A that is how I want my personality and 
                            designs to be. The horizontal line over A, which is very 
                            decoratively shown in this font, represents that I am very 
                            detail-oriented. The pointed nature of the typography shows 
                            that I am aggressive and curious, that is I try to probe every 
                            little detail I can find about the topic I am researching. The 
                            thickness and thinness in the fonts line quality depict the 
                            two ways of my personality. The heavy pressure on the font also 
                            shows that I take things seriously and try to finish them properly 
                            in my first attempt.

                                I have chosen the super unit to resemble a snowflake. 
                                Snowflakes signify me as a person, snowflakes as a whole 
                                are unique. The process of snowflakes falling to the ground 
                                is very systematic as they get heavier at each stage when 
                                nearing the surface. That is the way I have tried to model my life- a systematic set of a milestone to reach my final goal and to become the biggest fashion designer. My choice for snowflake also has a mythological meaning to it as snowflakes are created when the dust comes in contact with water vapor and I believe that we all have been formed from dust to live our moments and die into dust. 
                                The motif has been gradated and is diagonally symmetrical.

                                Blue is the color of the sky and sea and has always 
                                fascinated me since my childhood. It symbolizes trust, 
                                loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth, 
                                and heaven. Light Blue represents healing, tranquility, 
                                understanding, and softness. Dark Blue represents integrity 
                                and seriousness. It symbolizes the calm state of mind when it 
                                comes to taking certain decisions in my life and also the 
                                serious, focused and ambitious attitude mine towards my goals 
                                and career in my life.
